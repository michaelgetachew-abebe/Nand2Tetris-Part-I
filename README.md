# Nand2Tetris-Part-I
THIS REPOSITORY IS PART OF THE WORK THAT I HAVE DONE AS A PART OF THE NAND2TETRIS-PART 1 COURSE ON COURSERA BY NOAM NISAN & SHIMON SCHOCKEN. THE COURSE TEACHES HOW TO BUILD A MODERN COMPUTER FROM FIRST PRINCIPLES. THE JOUREY STARTS WITH GOD GIVING THE MANKIND A NAND GATE AND SAYING GO BUILD A COMPUTER.
